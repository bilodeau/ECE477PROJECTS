\section{Onboard Power} 

This section discusses how the copter distributes power.  An 18-volt 3-cell lithium polymer battery powers the quadrotorcopter. At full power this battery gives approximately 3-4 minutes of flying time. Lithium polymer batteries should never be subjected to an impact, overcharging, or undercharging.  Special precautions avoided these events.  ESCs monitored the battery charge levels to avoid a charge below the threshold. Foam padding secured the battery holder, avoiding severe impacts.    %We also programmed the north motor to sacrificially break it rotors to avoid further battery impact. 

Four electron speed control devices (ESCs) distribute the power and regulate current to the motors. The ESCs supply a 5V voltage regulator and a low battery-warning feature. The ESC voltage regulator was not used as the AVR voltage supply.   This way even if one particular motor stopped working the AVR would continue to function.  Two separate onboard voltage regulators drop the supply voltage down to 5-volts, used for the AVR, and 3.3 volts, supplied to the sensor.
