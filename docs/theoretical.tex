\section{PID Controllers}


The quadrotor uses different PID controllers to control flight. PID controllers were selected for easy tuning and effective control. 

\subsection{PID Theory}
Equation \ref{PIDgen} gives the generic equation for any PID controller. 

\begin{equation}
D(s) = K_p+\frac{K_i}{s}+K_ds
\label{PIDgen}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Proportional}

\subsubsection{Derivative}

\subsubsection{Integral}

\subsection{Controllers, Testing and Tuning}

The flight  PID control tunning applied the Ziegler-Nichols method as no knowledge of how to model the plant existed.
