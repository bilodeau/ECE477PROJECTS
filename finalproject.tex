\section{ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT}
This is supposed to be the basis of our final lab report.  Ideally, each section of the report will be fleshed out as we work on the project.  This should be mostly complete by the time we have stable flight.  Right now I've just got a list of concerns under each heading.  Most of the things listed are either a question that I don't have an answer to yet, or a task / subtask that we still need to complete.  I'm thinking that we can include the answers to these questions in the final spec / description of the project, and we can describe each element fully as we complete each associated task.

I've listed part numbers (and sparkfun SKUs, they have spec sheets and examples) for each of the devices I have already (or if they are in the mail).  If something is obviously wrong, or there's a much better alternative out there let me know ASAP so I can get something on order.  I'm anticipating placing another parts order in the near future so please share any 'maybe' ideas also.  I definitely do not want to run into a time crunch with parts still in the mail.

\section{Frame}
motor mounts
central joint
central platform
electronics mounting (sonar / sensors)
electonics protection
battery mount
battery protection
landing gear
ESC mounting
wire dressing

\section{Power}
11.8v spider (13 or 14 gauge?)
11.8v connectors
5-6v UBEC connectors
3.3v power supply (voltage regulator)
Li-Po alarm
battery life (on the order of 3-10minutes?)
do we need to order another / bigger battey pack?
battery charging is a little complicated
battery storage (thing is dangerous man)

\section{Communication}
PC to ATmega328 via serial
wireless coms over ZigBee?

fix serial input buffering on PC
dump all transmissions to log files on PC
detachable connector for the quadcopter end

Possible Commands to implement:

SHUTDOWN // turns off all motors.  do we want a remote power off for the AVR or sensors?
KILL // annihilates the human race
IDLE // spins all rotors at the minimum 'turnover' rate to save power without shutting down
LAND // stops any horizontal motion and lands in the current location
HOVER #some height#  // climbs or descends to the given altitude and stabilizes
ROTATE #degrees#     // spins the quadcopter around the yaw axis
DISCO BALL MODE      // note sure... this one was Brady's idea.
// some demo modes? various hover heights on a timer?  simple fly there and land?

\section{Motor Control}
I'm thinking we fly in '+' mode rather than 'X' mode.  We can label our motors as North, South, East, West, or maybe fore, aft, port, starboard?

What are the thrust limits for these motors / props? Any vibration or balancing issues?


ESC input spec (either PWM or pulse per second based?)
ESC 'programming' via full throttle/idle toggling on boot up
ESC modes are based on battery type?

\section{Microcontroller}
ATmega328 - the chip I have currently has an Arduino bootloader on it, not sure what that means with respect to fuses / programming

\section{Sensors}
what can we use for indoor (or short distance) position/movement sensing?
\subsection{Sonar}
PING))) Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
2 cm to 3m range
use for takeoff and landing as well as smart low altitude hold

\subsection{2-Axis Gyroscope}
IDG500 - SEN-09094
measures angular velocity
has 2 output pins for each axis, one high resolution, one low
need to filter output (probably in software) to adjust for vibration


\subsection{$I^2C$ Devices}
Logic Level Converter (BOB-08745)
The $I^2C$ devices below all run at 3.3v (except maybe the nunchuck?), but I do have a few of the 
converters listed above.  Probably could do it with just one converter if we have everything on one $I^2C$ bus.  I think $I^2C$ uses some sort of slave addressing protocol.

\subsubsection{Barometer}
BMP085 - SEN-09694
I think this device and the 2-Axis gyro both have some sort of temperature output which we should be able to use to correct for air pressure differences due to the outdoor temperature.  Hopefully we can get a reasonable altitude reading.

\subsubsection{3-Axis Magnetometer}
HMC5883L - SEN-10530
need to filter output (probably in software) to adjust for vibration
what's the magnetic declination here?
do we need to monitor all 3 axes or will just the yaw reading be enough?

\subsubsection{Accelerometer/Gyroscope}
Wii Nunchuck board (lots of hacking tutorials online)
pretty sure that the board takes care of all of the data combination / drift correction work for reading angular position, we just have to interface with it serial
need to filter output (probably in software) to adjust for vibration

\subsubsection{GPS}
MediaTek MT3329 GPS 10Hz (got this from DIYDrones.com.  I believe it has custom firmware at the moment and they've got some spec sheets up on the site.)
position data format
position data resolution
velocity data format
velocity data resolution
imput power source has to meet some particular specs (low ripple?) in order to guarantee that we get good data
